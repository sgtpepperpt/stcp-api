# STCP API

Unofficial API to retrieve STCP information for public transit buses in Porto, Portugal.

Retrieves static data about lines, stops, locations, and real-time estimates of bus arrivals.

Since it's based on a non-official API, it may stop working in the future. Confirmed working as of 31 July 2025.

See the files at [stcp/api.py](stcp/api.py) and [stcp/util.py](stcp/util.py) for the complete documentation,
and [examples.md](examples.md) for usage examples.

| _get_line_stops_      | gets a list of all stops of a line.                                                                |

## Utilities

| **Function**      | **Description**                                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| _get_all_stops_   | gets a set of all STCP stop codes across all lines.           |
| _stop_departures_ | gets a map of upcoming departures of a stop, grouped by line. |
| _follow_line_     | gets the current times for a given line.                      |


## Notes

To be able to get a stop's real-time departures, a "hash" is needed, which can be obtained by scraping STCP's webpage.
These hashes are stored in a local CSV cache for efficiency purposes, which is generated on the first execution.
However, the cache can be disabled, and the hash request can be made on-the-fly, by passing `use_hash_cache=False` to
the _get_stop_real_times_ function.
